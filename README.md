For the past 10 years, my focus has been software-defined networking, network programmability and infrastructure automation. Previously I developed and wrote many Cisco Validated Design guides on QoS enabled, encrypted Voice and Video using IPSec over the public Internet. As a network consulting engineer, I supported large enterprise customers.
